# DulceBotRAG
This project is a production-ready RAG pipeline that connects WhatsApp and Telegram to a Python retrieval service via RabbitMQ. It auto-discovers domain knowledge from Markdown/JSON files, embeds and searches it, and replies in real time through platform bots. Docker Compose makes it easy to run locally with minimal setup.
